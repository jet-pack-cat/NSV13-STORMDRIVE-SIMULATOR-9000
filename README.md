Donlt input commands or numbers incorrectly or you DIE

commands and operands can be put on the same line to some degree.
example:

fueledit

GAS_O2

14

GAS_N2

15

GAS_PLASMA 42

mols

100

view

save

close



AND:



fueledit GAS_O2 14 GAS_N2 15 GAS_PLASMA 42 mols 100 view save close

are functionally equivalent.
